Vagrantfile for easy set-up of Open TEE development environment


Requirements
------------

* Possibly recent version of Vagrant (was tested using 1.6.5)

Usage
-----

In the directory where you cloned this repository:

    $ vagrant up

This should set up Ubuntu 14.04 into virtual machine with required
dependencies to build Open TEE.

To build the code:

    $ vagrant ssh
    $ cd open-tee
    $ qbs

The open-tee folder in virtual machine is shared with the one on the 
host operating system, so you can use whatever editor you like.


Step-by-step instructions for setting up Vagrant
------------------------------------------------

First of all, check that you have virtualization extensions enabled in BIOS
settings.  The vagrant up command that will be run later on will fail if you
don't have virtualization extensions enabled.

Providing shell commands for Ubuntu for convenience butÂ these instructions can
be applied for other distributions as well.

First install VirtualBox.

    $ apt-get install virtualbox

Download and install Vagrant for your operating system. You can get Vagrant
from https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

    $ wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/vagrant/vagrant_1.7.2_x86_64.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i vagrant_1.7.2_x86_64.deb

If your internet access on your company's network is behind proxy, please
follow the instructions to install and configure vagrant-proxyconf at:
https://github.com/tmatilai/vagrant-proxyconf#quick-start

Clone this repository somewhere:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Open-TEE/opentee-vagrant.git

Then provision the virtual machine by running vagrant up in opentee-vagrant
directory.

    $ cd opentee-vagrant
    $ vagrant up

Now you should have your Vagrant environment set up. The open-tee directory is
mapped to /home/vagrant/open-tee inside the virtual machine so you can use your
favourite editor from outside the VM.

To log into the VM, run:

    $ vagrant ssh


Q & A
-----

In case you get some error message about ubuntu/trusty64 box not being found,
you can try to manually add Vagrant Box for Ubuntu.

    $ vagrant box add ubuntu/trusty64 https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/trusty/current/trusty-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box
